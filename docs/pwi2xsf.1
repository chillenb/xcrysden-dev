.RI [ \-r ]
\fIfile\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpwi2xsf\fR extracts the atomic structure from \fBpw.x\fR or
\fBneb.x\fR input file and prints the XSF formatted structure data to
standard output.  It is a utility program of \fBxcrysden\fR package
(\fIhttp://www.xcrysden.org/\fR) and XSF is the native \fBxcrysden
structure format\fR (\fIhttp://www.xcrysden.org/doc/XSF.html\fR).

If \fIfile\fR is specified as "-" then standard input is read.

.SH OPTION

.TP 4
\fB\-r 
For old \fBpw.x\fR versions < 1.2 one must spefify the
\fIityp\fR-->\fInat\fR conversion and the corresponding data are
written to file \fInuclei.charges\fR. The \fB\-r\fR flag deletes this
file as to force new \fIityp\fR-->\fInat\fR specification.
