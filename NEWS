Version: 1.6:
-------------

* "Reload" button added to the main window (at the bottom toolbar)
  that reloads the structure from file; useful for structure building

* lattice-vector reduction (Wigner-Seitz cell and Brilluouin-zone were
  incorrect for non-reduced lattice-vectors)

* compatibility with Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) 6.x, in particular:
  - display of structures from neb.x input file
  - aware of the new ibrav lattice definitions of QE (e.g. negative
    ibrav and ibrav=91);
  - display of conventional cell-mode for centered lattice display
    from pw.x output    
  - compatible with "ATOMIC_POSITIONS (crystal_sg)" specs, but it
    needs pw.x on $PATH

* compatibility with CRYSTAL17

* ported to Tcl/Tk-8.6 (thanks to Julien Lefevre) and Togl-2.0

* because the API of Togl2.0 changed, the syntax of *.xcrysden scripts
  changed as well (for the Togl part); old *.xcrysden scripts can be
  loaded with --os or --oldscript command line option

* Togl options can be specified in ~/.xcrysden/custom-definitions file
  (e.g. if xcrysden crashes with "X Error of failed request: ...", try
  setting "set toglOpt(accum) false"; but beware that this disables
  anti-aliasing)

* if "Print To File" produces blank images, add "set printSetup(dumpWindow) 1"
  to ~/.xcrysden/custom-definitions file

* correct illumination of isosurfaces even if the DATAGRID box is
  left-oriented (cube files in Gaussian use left-oriented boxes);

* new "File-->Save Current State" menu entry. It saves only a display
  "state" of the currently displyed structure; this is useful for
  scripting (see below item)

* new "--print" command line option for batch printing. This is useful
  within the shell scripts to achieve "automatic" printing. Example:
  xcrysden --xsf file.xsf --script state.xcrysden --print file.png

* bug-fix: Wien2K examples (File-->XCrySDen Examples ...-->WIEN2K Struct Files)
  did not work if xcrysden was installed to read-only path


Version: 1.5:
-------------

* display of structure from Orca output

* new Movie-Maker: xcrysden allows for real-time capture of display. Three
  modes are supported: "real-time capture", "every redisplay", and
  "manual".

* several movie encoders are supported, in particular

  - for Animated-GIF: convert (from ImageMagick), gifsicle, and
    whirlgif; convert is used by default. 

  - for AVI/MPEG: mencoder (from mplayer) and ppmtompeg. Mencoder is
    used by default.

* better algorithm for isosurface shading (nicer surfaces)

* no more external package specifications in
  ~/.xcrysden/custom-definitions, due to automatic package finding
  mechanism. The only exception is the CRYSTAL package
  (http://www.crystal.unito.it/), which still needs to be explicitly
  defined.

* customization of Fermi surface viewer is possible in ~/.xcrysden/custom-definitions

* new command-line option --custom for reading customization from specified file

* compatibility with Quantum-Espresso 5.x, WIEN2k_08+, and CRYSTAL14

* XCRYSDEN_TOPDIR and XCRYSDEN_SCRATCH environmental variables are not
  required anymore. The use of the former is deprecated and the latter
  is set to /tmp if unspecified.

* the use of "xcConfigure" is deprecated

* "make install" now installs the package system-wide (see README file
  for more details).

* ~/.xcrysden/Xcrysden_resources is used instead of
  ~/.xcrysden/Xcrysden_defaults. This is due to a new font handling
  mechanism in The Tcl/Tk 8.5, which makes the fonts as specified by
  old ~/.xcrysden/Xcrysden_defaults to look pretty ugly.

* improved measurement procedure: the selection of atoms is more
  precise (i.e. easier) and the coordinates of mouse-click selected
  atoms can be displayed in Angstrom, Bohr, crystal-primitive,
  crystal-conventional, and alat units. Measured distances are
  reported also in bohr units, and the printout format of measured
  distances and angles is configurable

* adding mouse-wheel support for display-zooming (I finally got a
  mouse with a wheel).

* a "stop-playing" button added to animations control window 

* crystal borders are displayed by default for periodic structures

* checking for stale files in $XCRYSDEN_SCRATCH (prompts the user for their deletion)

* only one flavor of source package (external library sources are
  download and compiled on request)

* many bug fixes 

* for further information, see ChangeLog


Version: 1.4:
-------------

* automatic labeling of k-points for k-path selection
  (thanks to Peter Blaha)

* Stereo display mode (thanks to Gerardo Ballabio)

* Anaglyph display mode, i.e., fake stereo, requires red-blue glasses
  (thanks to Eric VERFAILLIE)

* a few Bug fixes in visualization of Fermi surfaces (thanks to Pablo
  de la Mora)

* improved EPS printing (also PDF printing) thanks to new
  gl2ps-1.2.4. The vectorial EPS printing of Lighting-On mode is
  finally good enough.

* comments added to the XSF format; comment-lines start with the "#"
  character and can be located only in between the sections, but
  within a given section.


Version: Beta-1.2
-----------------

* improved visualization of Fermi surfaces (a few Bug fixes; thanks to Pablo de la Mora)

* visualization of vector-fields

* dummy "X" atom does not have bonds anymore

* multi-band display of Fermi surfaces in one widget

* added support for CRYSTAL03

* more configurable options for forces (color, thickness)

* Coordinate system color is configurable


Version: Beta-1.0
-----------------

* XCRYSDEN covered by GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

* XCRYSDEN ported to MAC OSX (requires Xserver)

* XCRYSDEN ported to MS-Windows (under CYGWIN). Does not require
  X-server, but require CYGWIN (http://www.cygwin.com/).

* Visualization of H-bonds (lighting-on mode only).

* Update of the PWscf IO filters (compatible with PWscf v.2.0).

* XCRYSDEN interface was mad compatible with CRYSTAL03

* Simple bond editing: the covalent-radius item
  (Modify-->Atomic Radius menu) has been split into
  covalent- and display-radius items. By changing the covalent radii
  of given atomic types the display of bonds can be altered.

* Improved "Save Current State and Structure" mechanism.

* XCRYSDEN can be embedded in an another aplication's window
  by using --use option, i.e., "xcrysden --use window-id".

* Adding reduce "-r" option to reduce the dimensionality of the
  structure (works for XSF file only): "xcrysden -r 2 --xsf file.xsf"
  will display the structure from file.xsf as slab (dim=2) even if it
  was specified as crystal (dim=3) in file.xsf

* Visualization of Fermi surfaces a bit improved

* Some bug fixes ...

* Fixing bug for transformation of selected k-points to WIEN2k format
  (fixed by Florent Boucher). BEWARE: it seems this transformation
  remains buggy. Use at your own risk, and please, check carefully
  every time the resultant klist file: the program prints some useful
  supporting information during the transformation to WIEN2k format.
