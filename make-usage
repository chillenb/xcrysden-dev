	* First copy an appropriate system/Make.* to ./Make.sys
	  and edit it according to your needs, i.e:

		\$ cp system/Make.MY_SYSTEM Make.sys

	* Then to compile the package type:  
 
		\$ make all

          If everything compiled well, xcrysden should work. You can try: ./xcrysden
          
	* Optionally you may do:

		\$ prefix=XXXX make install
                
          where XXXX is a directory where to install xcysden. BEWARE:
          please read first the below description of "install" target
          before issuing this command.


 ==============================================================================
               * * * Here is a list of make targets * * *
 ==============================================================================

Usage: make  all | clean | clean-external-src

    --
    all:

	all = bindir + tcl + tk + togl + mesa + fftw + xcrysden

	The "make all" simply makes all. That is: compiles all the
	source files and creates the executables.

	If external/src/ subdirectory exists, then it also downloads and
	compiles all the external libraries (Tcl/Tk, Togl, Mesa,
	FFTW), which were requested for compilation by
	COMPILE_package=yes variable in Make.sys.

    --
    install:

	Installs the compiled package systemwide to a
	\$prefix/share/xcrysden-version/ and
	\$prefix/lib/xcrysden-version/ directories and makes xcrysden
	wrapper in \$prefix/bin/. The default value of \$prefix is
	/usr/local, but this can be changed by running as:

	"prefix=XXXX make install".        

        BEWARE: assumes that Tcl/Tk/Togl/GL/GLU/FFTW libraries are
	available system-wide (i.e. it will not install the internally
	complied libraries that reside in external/lib subdirectory).
	
    --
    clean | veryclean | distclean:

	Various levels of cleaning.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------


  The following targets are suitable only for developers, for making
  various package distributions:

    --
    srcdist:
	Creates the source tar.gz package-archive.

    --
    bindist-shared:
	Creates the shared binary tar.gz package-archive. Note: you should
        previously compile the xcrysden package.

    --
    bindist-semishared:
	Creates the shared binary tar.gz package-archive with the Tcl, Tk, 
        and Mesa shared libraries in external/lib subdirectory. Note: you should
        previously compile the xcrysden package with the internally compiled
        Tcl/Tk/Togl/GL/GLU/FFTW libraries that reside in external/lib subdirectory.

    --
    bindist-static:
	Creates the statically linked binary tar.gz package-archive. Note: 
	you should previously compile the xcrysden package and link it with 
	static libraries.
