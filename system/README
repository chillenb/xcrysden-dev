NOTE: It is the easiest to compile the shared version of xcrysden,
because it is more easy to install library dependencies with a package
manager system, such as apt or dnf, then to compile needed libraries
from sources.

The compilation of xcrysden requires several development versions of
libraries, in particular:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** To compile SHARED version of xcrysden the following libraries are needed:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

libx11-dev
libxmu-dev
tcl8.6-dev
tk8.6-dev
mesa-common-dev
libglu1-mesa-dev
libtogl-dev
libfftw3-dev

N.B.: these are Debian package names. On Debian based distributions,
they can be installed as:

sudo apt install libx11-dev libxmu-dev tcl8.6-dev tk8.6-dev mesa-common-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libtogl-dev libfftw3-dev

NOTE FOR OTHER LINUX-DISTROS: first google for the correponding
package names and then install them with the correponding package
manager (e.g. "dnf" for Fedora based distros).


------------------------------------------------------------------------
** To compile SEMISHARED version of xcrysden one needs:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

libx11-dev
libxmu-dev
pkg-config
libxrandr-dev
llvm-dev
libelf-dev

N.B.: these are Debian package names that can be install via "apt
install" on Debian based distributions.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** To use SHARED version of xcrysden the following libraries are needed:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


libxmu6
tk8.6
libglu1-mesa
libtogl2
libfftw3-3
libgfortran5
